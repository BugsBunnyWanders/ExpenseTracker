# ExpenseTracker Project - Current State

## Overview

The ExpenseTracker is a React Native mobile application built with Expo and Supabase for tracking personal and group expenses. The app allows users to:

- Create and manage user accounts
- Create expense groups and add members
- Track personal and group expenses
- Calculate balances and settle debts
- Invite non-registered users via email

## Current Status

### Completed Features

- User authentication (signup, login, logout) using Supabase Auth
- User profile management
- Core database schema in Supabase for:
  - User profiles
  - Groups
  - Expenses
  - Settlements
  - Group invitations
- Proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data access
- Improved error handling for database operations
- Database verification utilities
- Complete expense tracking UI with INR currency support
- Expense details page with edit and delete functionality
- Settlement process implementation in groups
- Settle up functionality for recording completed settlements
- Real-time UI updates after settlement completion using RefreshContext
- Group invitation system with email notifications
- Multi-tier email sending system with fallback options
- Custom split functionality for group expenses:
  - UI for specifying custom split amounts for each member
  - Real-time validation of split amounts
  - Visual indicators for split status (correct, incomplete, excess)
  - Balance calculations supporting both equal and custom splits

### In Progress Features

- Data visualization for expense trends
- Attachment handling for expense receipts

### Fixed Issues

1. **Empty Error Objects**: Fixed issue with empty error objects being returned from Supabase operations which indicated missing database tables or incorrect permissions
2. **Profile Creation Race Conditions**: Improved the profile creation process to handle situations where the database trigger and manual creation might conflict
3. **Database Verification**: Added a comprehensive database check script to verify if required tables exist
4. **Missing getUsersByIds Function**: Added missing function in userService.js to retrieve multiple user profiles by their IDs in a single operation, enabling proper group member data display
5. **Missing calculateSettlementPlan Function**: Added missing function in settlementService.js to calculate an optimal debt settlement plan for a group, minimizing the number of transactions needed
6. **Currency Display**: Updated all currency displays to use INR (â‚¹) as the default currency instead of USD
7. **Settlement Flow**: Implemented a complete settlement flow for groups, allowing users to record completed settlements
8. **Settlement UI Updates**: Fixed issue where settlement updates weren't reflecting in the UI until manual refresh
9. **Permission Denied for Group Invitations**: Fixed RLS policies to eliminate "permission denied for table users" errors
10. **User ID Reference Issues**: Fixed references to user IDs to consistently use Supabase conventions

### Known Issues

1. **SQL Script Execution**: The custom script for executing SQL statements requires the `run_sql_query` RPC function, which may not exist in all Supabase instances. Manual SQL execution in the Supabase dashboard is recommended.

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

The database includes the following tables:

- `groups`: Group information and members
- `expenses`: Expense records (personal and group)
- `settlements`: Records of debt settlements
- `group_invitations`: Invitations to join groups for non-registered users

Each table has appropriate RLS policies to ensure proper access control.

## Technical Issues Fixed
