# ExpenseTracker Project - Current State

## Overview

The ExpenseTracker is a React Native mobile application built with Expo and Supabase for tracking personal and group expenses. The app allows users to:

- Create and manage user accounts
- Create expense groups and add members
- Track personal and group expenses
- Calculate balances and settle debts

## Current Status

### Completed Features

- User authentication (signup, login, logout) using Supabase Auth
- User profile management
- Core database schema in Supabase for:
  - User profiles
  - Groups
  - Expenses
  - Settlements
- Proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data access
- Improved error handling for database operations
- Database verification utilities
- Complete expense tracking UI with INR currency support
- Expense details page with edit and delete functionality
- Settlement process implementation in groups
- Settle up functionality for recording completed settlements

### In Progress Features

- Group management UI
- Data visualization for expense trends
- Attachment handling for expense receipts
- Auto-refresh after settlement completion (currently requires manual refresh)

### Fixed Issues

1. **Empty Error Objects**: Fixed issue with empty error objects being returned from Supabase operations which indicated missing database tables or incorrect permissions
2. **Profile Creation Race Conditions**: Improved the profile creation process to handle situations where the database trigger and manual creation might conflict
3. **Database Verification**: Added a comprehensive database check script to verify if required tables exist
4. **Missing getUsersByIds Function**: Added missing function in userService.js to retrieve multiple user profiles by their IDs in a single operation, enabling proper group member data display
5. **Missing calculateSettlementPlan Function**: Added missing function in settlementService.js to calculate an optimal debt settlement plan for a group, minimizing the number of transactions needed
6. **Currency Display**: Updated all currency displays to use INR (â‚¹) as the default currency instead of USD
7. **Settlement Flow**: Implemented a complete settlement flow for groups, allowing users to record completed settlements

### Known Issues

1. **Manual Refresh Required**: After settling expenses, a manual refresh is needed to see updated balances in the group and dashboard screens.

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

The database includes the following tables:
